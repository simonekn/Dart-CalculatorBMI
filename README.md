# BMI Calculator - Dart Project"

This Dart project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator created as part of the [Dio (Digital Innovation One)](https://www.dio.me/en) course in partnership with the [Santander Scholarships program](https://www.becas-santander.com/pt_br/index.html). 

The BMI calculator takes user inputs such as name, weight, and height, and handles exceptions to ensure data integrity. It calculates the BMI and displays the result on the screen. Additionally, this project includes unit tests to verify its functionality.
